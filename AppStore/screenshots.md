# Screenshot Plan (Draft)

Use the latest App Store Connect size requirements for the devices you target. Suggested capture set:

1. Onboarding - Welcome screen
2. Home - Categories grid + search
3. Calculator - Example: Cp/Cpk inputs
4. Results - Cp/Cpk result cards + interpretation
5. Control Chart - Chart example with out-of-control highlight
6. History - Recent calculations list
7. Paywall - Subscription options
8. Settings - Restore purchases + version

Tips
- Use realistic example data and clean formatting.
- Keep top areas uncluttered for App Store overlays.
- Ensure premium badge/paywall is visible in at least one shot.

Data guide: see `AppStore/screenshot_data.md`.
